# Requirements
## Introduction
 This is a calculator project which implements all mathematical operations along with the pyramid and right angled triangle with numbers

## Research
* The main aim of the calculator project is to implement mathematical operations.
* We have functions to implement this.
* Using these functions and adding two new features to it will make it look more advanced. 
## Cost and Features

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

Any one who wants to perform calculator operations can use it.

## What:

Many make mistakes in calculations when they are in a hurry. This helps to reduce the errors in calculations.

## When:

When calculations are done in a hurry, there is a chance for misinterpretation of results. A small error can cause a lot of damage.

## Where:

Can use it in online exams for fast calculation

## How:

It can make calculations simpler and the results are accurate.
